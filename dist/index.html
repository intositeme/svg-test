		<div id="scrollContainer" class="customblock" style="height:50%; width:50;">
			<div id="scroller" style="overflow: auto; cursor: move; touch-action: none; -webkit-user-select: none;"><div style="display: block; width: 100%; padding-right: 118px; position: relative; overflow: visible; vertical-align: top; z-index: 0; transform: translate3d(0px, 0px, 0px);">
				<h2 style="margin-top:0">Drag me to scroll me</h2>
				<p>Click and drag this content and then let go as you're dragging to throw it. Notice how it smoothly glides
				   to a rest, respecting the initial velocity and even permitting overscolling with bounce-back without forcing
				   fake/simulated scrollbars. It's actually using the <code>scrollTop</code> or <code>scrollLeft</code> of the container, and then if/when
				   it exceeds the bounds, it'll apply a <code>translate3d()</code> transform for hardware-accelerated performance, and it'll
				   even fall back to using padding when 3D transforms aren't available. Yes, it even works in IE8!</p>

				<h2>How does it work?</h2>

				<p>When you create the Draggable with <code>type:"scroll"</code> (or <code>"scrollTop"</code> or <code>"scrollLeft"</code>), it will create a
					<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and wrap it around the native content of the target element so that it can move things appropriately.
				   So that wrapper div ends up being the only child of the element. Then, as you drag, it updates the <code>scrollTop</code>/<code>scrollLeft</code>
				   of the element until you exceed the bounds at which time it'll either add a <code>translate3d()</code> CSS transform
				   (if supported) to that wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or fall back to using padding for older browsers.</p>

				<p>This gives you the best of both worlds - it delivers <strong>native</strong> scrolling with normal
				   scrollbar UI that's built into the OS/browser, plus outstanding performance on mobile devices due to the
					<code>translate3d()</code> sweetness on overscroll, and compatibility even with IE8, all in a 3.4k gzipped footprint
				   (not including TweenLite or CSSPlugin which are required).</p>

				<p>Oh, and don't forget the kinetic-based flick scrolling that's enabled when you load ThrowPropsPlugin and
				   set <code>throwProps:true</code> in the config object. When you drag past the normal scrolling limits, the <code>edgeResistance</code>
				   kicks in (you control how much). It just "feels" natural and fluid, much more so than most other options out there.</p>

				<p>Did we mention Draggable works great with touch events too? And if the user flick-scrolls and then
				   while it's animating, they use their mouse wheel or grab the scrollbar to take control themselves,
				   Draggable automatically releases control and stops the animation. Don't worry your pretty little head.</p>

				<h2>Usage</h2>

				<p>Setup is a breeze. One line is all you need:</p>

				<pre class="prettyprint lang-js prettyprinted" style="overflow-x: auto;"><span class="typ">Draggable</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">create</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"#container"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln">type</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="str">"scroll"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> throwProps</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="kwd">true</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> edgeResistance</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="lit">0.35</span><span class="pun">});</span></pre>

				<p><strong>That's it!</strong></p>

				<p>Of course you can tweak the configuration however you please. Want to only scroll vertically?
				   Use <code>type:"scrollTop"</code>. Or for horizontal scrolling, use <code>type:"scrollLeft"</code>. When you use simply
					<code>type:"scroll"</code>, it allows scrolling in either direction.</p>

				<p>Change the <code>edgeResistance</code> to 1 if you don't want the user to be able to drag past the edge.</p>

				<p>Note that ThrowPropsPlugin is a membership benefit of <a href="http://www.greensock.com/club/">Club GreenSock</a>
				   ("Shockingly Green" and "Business Green" levels), but the Draggable works fine without that - you
				   just won't get the kinetic-based motion. You can still drag things.</p>

				<h2>Not just for scrolling</h2>
				<p>As you can see from the examples above, Draggable is multi-talented. Change the <code>type</code> to <code>"x,y"</code> to make
				   the entire object draggable around the screen (literally moving it, not scrolling). Or <code>type:"top,left"</code> does the same thing,
				   but uses the <code>"top"</code> and <code>"left"</code> css properties instead of <code>translateX()</code> and <code>translateY()</code> CSS transforms.
				   Or if you want to be able to drag-spin an object, use <code>type:"rotation"</code>. In fact, it'll even honor the
				   <code>transform-origin</code> of the element. </p>
